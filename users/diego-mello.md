Introduction

### About Me

With over a decade of experience in the tech industry, I have honed my skills in full-stack development, cloud computing, and distributed systems. My journey has taken me through various roles, from software engineer to architect, and now as a tech lead, I am committed to driving innovation and excellence within my team.

### What I Do

At Full Stackers, we focus on creating seamless and efficient event-driven architectures that enhance the performance and scalability of our applications. My role involves:

- **Architecture Design**: Crafting scalable and resilient system architectures using event-driven paradigms.
- **Team Leadership**: Guiding a talented team of developers, fostering a collaborative and innovative environment.
- **Code Reviews & Mentorship**: Ensuring code quality and sharing knowledge to help the team grow.
- **Stakeholder Collaboration**: Working closely with other teams and stakeholders to align our technical solutions with business goals.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Advocating for best practices in software development, deployment, and monitoring.

I am passionate about leveraging the power of events to build systems that are not only highly responsive but also easier to maintain and extend. In an ever-evolving tech landscape, I strive to stay ahead of the curve, continuously learning and adapting to new technologies and methodologies.

Feel free to connect with me to discuss all things tech, event-driven architectures, or to exchange ideas on building better software systems!
